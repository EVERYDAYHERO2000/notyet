        <h1>Website, Application, and Device User Terms of Use</h1>
         
        <p>Last Modified: June 2023</p>
         
        <h3>Acceptance of the Terms of Use</h3>
         
        <p>Welcome to the website operated by NotYet Inc. (“NotYet,” “we,” “us” or “our”). The following terms
            and conditions (“Terms of Use”), govern your access to and use of the NotYet website, health
            monitoring service offered by NotYet (“Monitoring Service”), the associated NotYet health
            monitoring wearable device and any other hardware devices we may make available (collectively, the
            “Device”), and the NotYet mobile application (the “App,” collectively with the Device and Monitoring
            Service, the “Services”).</p>
         
        <p>You understand the Services do not render medical advice or diagnose or prevent any specific disease,
            including any communicable disease or virus. If you have any concerns about your health, including whether
            you have been exposed to or have contracted any disease or virus, immediately contact your healthcare
            provider.</p>
         
        <p>IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, YOU SHOULD DIAL “911” IMMEDIATELY.</p>
         
        <p>Our Services are not for medical emergencies or urgent situations. You should not disregard or
            delay to seek medical advice based on anything that appears or does not appear on the Services. If you
            believe you have an emergency, call 9-1-1 immediately.</p>
         
        <p>Please read these Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Services. By using the Services, you
            accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use <a
                href="https://notyet.tech/documents/terms_of_use">https://notyet.tech/documents/terms_of_use</a> and
            Privacy Policy <a
                href="https://notyet.tech/documents/privacy_policy">https://notyet.tech/documents/privacy_policy</a>,
            which is incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy,
            you must not access or use the Services. Capitalized terms used but not defined in these Terms of Use have
            the meaning given to them in our other policies (e.g., our Privacy Policy).</p>
         
        <p>The Services are offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not collect or
            maintain personal information from people we actually know are under 18 years old. If we obtain actual
            knowledge that a user is under 18 years old, we will use our best efforts to remove that person’s
            information from our database. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18
            years old and of legal age to form a binding contract with us. If you do not meet all of these requirements,
            you must not access or use the Services. If you believe we have collected personal information from someone
            under the age of 18, please contact us at info@notyet.tech.</p>
         
         
         
        <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
         
        <p>These Terms of Use provide that all disputes between you and NotYet that in any way relate to these Terms of
            Use or your use of the Services will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. ACCORDINGLY, YOU AGREE TO GIVE
            UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT (INCLUDING IN A CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING) to assert or defend your rights under
            these Terms of Use. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury and your
            claims cannot be brought as a class action. Please review the Section below entitled Dispute Resolution for
            the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with NotYet.</p>
         
        <h3>Changes to the Terms of Use</h3>
         
        <p>We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are
            effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter.
            Your continued use or visitation of the Services following the posting of revised Terms of Use means
            that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page from time to time so you are
            aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. You may also print a copy of these Terms of Use for your
            reference using the print functionality in your browser, but only the most current version of these Terms of
            Use will apply to the Services.</p>
         
        <h3>Services; No Medical or Legal Advice by NotYet</h3>
         
        <p>NotYet offers a platform for monitoring vital sign, physiologic and symptomatic event health monitoring,
            analysis and reporting that may facilitate communication between you and your health care provider (each, a
            “Provider”) (if you are a Provider, please review the section below entitled Supplemental Terms
            Applicable to Providers), or family member or friend (each, an “Caretaker”). This health information may
            include respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, activity level, sleep duration, body
            position, step count, gait analysis, coughing, sneezing and vomit frequency and other symptomatic or
            biometric data. NotYet does not provide medical advice or care itself. Rather, your Provider the Services to
            better provide clinical services to his or her patients, or your Observer uses the Services to monitor your
            health in order to provide better care for you. The Providers and/or the Caretakers, and not NotYet,
            are responsible for the quality and appropriateness of the care that is rendered for you.</p>
         
        <p>The Providers are independent of NotYet. Any information or advice received from a Provider comes from them
            alone, and not from NotYet. Your interactions with the Providers via our products and services are not
            intended to take the place of your relationship with your regular health care practitioners or primary care
            physician. Neither NotYet, nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any third party who may promote the
            Services or provide a link to the Services, shall be liable for any professional advice obtained from a
            Provider via the Services, nor any information obtained on the Services. NotYet does not recommend or
            endorse any specific Providers, tests, physicians, medications, products, or procedures. You acknowledge
            that your reliance on any Providers or information delivered by the Providers via or because of the
            information on the Services is solely at your own risk and you assume full responsibility for all risks
            associated herewith.</p>
         
        <p>NotYet does not make any representations or warranties about the training or skill of any Providers who
            deliver services to you based on your use of the Services. The content of the Services, including text,
            copy, audio, video, photographs, illustrations, graphics, and other visuals, is for informational purposes
            only and does not constitute professional legal or medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or recommendations
            of any kind by NotYet. NotYet does not provide any legal advice or representations in any way regarding any
            legal issues associated with advice, information, goods, or services offered by a Provider, including but
            not limited to any compliance obligations or steps necessary to comply with any state or federal laws and
            regulations. You should always seek the advice of your qualified health care professionals with any
            questions or concerns you may have regarding your individual needs and any medical conditions. All
            information provided by NotYet, or in connection with any communications supported by NotYet, is intended to
            be for general information purposes only, and is in no way intended to create a provider-patient
            relationship as defined by state or federal law.</p>
         
        <p>You should seek emergency help or follow up care when recommended by a Provider or when otherwise needed. You
            should continue to consult with your primary provider and other healthcare professionals as recommended.
            Always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified healthcare provider concerning questions you have
            regarding a medical condition and before stopping, starting, or modifying any treatment or modification.</p>
         
        <h3>Accessing the Services and Account Security</h3>
         
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate or amend the Services, and any service or material we provide on the
            Services, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of
            the Services is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some
            parts of the Services or the entire Services.</p>
         
        <p>The Services are available only to users who set up an account (“Account”). To access the Services, you
            may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of your use of
            the Services that all the information you provide on the Services is correct, current and complete.</p>

            security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any
            other person or entity. You represent and warrant that all information and materials you submit, publish,
            post, or otherwise through the Services is true and accurate and not fraudulent or misleading in any
            reasonable way. You acknowledge that your Account is personal to you and you agree not to provide any other
            person with access to the Services or portions of it using your username, password, or other security
            information. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your username or
            password or any other breach of security. You also agree to ensure that you exit from your Account at the
            end of each session. You should use particular caution when accessing your Account from a public or shared
            computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information. We have
            the right to disable any username, password or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at
            any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any
            provision of these Terms of Use. We may rely on the authority of anyone accessing your Account or using your
            login credentials and in no event and under no circumstances shall we be held liable to you for any
            liabilities or damages resulting from or arising out of (i) any action or inaction by us under this
            provision, (ii) any compromise of the confidentiality of your Account or password, and (iii) any
            unauthorized access to your Account or use of your password.</p>

        <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
         
        <p>In the event of any dispute, claim, question or disagreement arising from or relating to this Agreement, or
            the relationship that results from this Agreement (a “Dispute”), the parties hereto shall use their best
            efforts to settle the Dispute. To this end, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good
            faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory
            to both parties. If the parties do not reach such solution, then the Dispute shall be resolved by binding
            arbitration in Wilmington, Delaware, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
            Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), subject to the limitations of this section. This agreement to arbitrate
            will be specifically enforceable under the prevailing law of any court having jurisdiction. Notice of a
            demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the other party hereto and with the AAA. To the extent
            permitted by law, any Dispute under this Agreement must be filed within one year in an arbitration
            proceeding. The one-year period begins when the claim or notice of dispute first could be filed. If a claim
            or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.</p>
         
        <p>The parties agree that one (1) arbitrator shall arbitrate the Dispute. The arbitrator shall be selected by
            the joint agreement of the parties, but if they do not so agree within twenty (20) days after the date of
            the notice of a demand for arbitration referred to above, the selection shall be made pursuant to the
            Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA from the panels of business arbitrators maintained by the AAA. The
            decision of the arbitrator shall be made in writing, shall be final, judgment may be entered upon it in any
            court having jurisdiction thereof, and the decision shall not be subject to vacation, modification or
            appeal, except to the extent permitted by sections 10 and 11 of the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of
            which sections the parties agree shall apply. You and we agree that (i) no arbitration proceeding whether a
            consumer or business dispute will be certified as a class action or proceed as a class action, or on a basis
            involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other
            customers or potential customers or persons similarly situated, and (ii) no arbitration proceeding shall be
            consolidated with, or joined in any way with, any other arbitration proceeding and the arbitrator may not
            otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. WE AND YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATE A
            CONSUMER DISPUTE OR BUSINESS DISPUTE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER
            REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION, SEEK RELIEF ON A
            CLASS BASIS, OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. Further, unless both you and we agree in writing otherwise,
            the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
            form of a representative or class proceeding. The expenses of arbitration, including reasonable attorneys’
            fees and the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, shall be shared equally by the parties.</p>
         
        <p>Either party may bring a claim related to intellectual property rights, or seek temporary and preliminary
            specific performance and injunctive relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the posting of
            bond or other security.</p>
         
        <p>YOU AND NOTYET AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY,
            AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless
            both you and NotYet agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with
            your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The
            arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief
            and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.</p>
         
        <p>If the arbitration terms and conditions of this Section are found to be unenforceable, then (i) the entirety
            of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, but the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use
            shall remain in full force and effect, and (ii) exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in
            state or federal courts located in and for Wilmington, Delaware.</p>
         
        <h3>Supplemental Terms Applicable to Providers</h3>
         
        <p>These supplemental terms apply to Providers in addition to the other provisions of these Terms of Use. In the
            event of a conflict between the supplemental terms and any other terms herein, the supplemental terms shall
            prevail.</p>
         
        <p>To be a healthcare provider using the Services (for purposes of this Section, “Provider” or “you”) you must
            be a licensed physician, nurse practitioner, or healthcare professional in contract NotYet, and must agree
            to comply with all laws, medical board rules, and other rules and regulations applicable to you as a
            Provider or otherwise. Your relationship with the Service users is directly between you and the patient. The
            patient will never have a physician-patient relationship with NotYet. NotYet does not practice medicine and
            offers no medical services. As set forth more fully below, Provider is solely responsible for all
            agreements, consents, notices, and other interactions with patients and other consumers. Without limiting
            the generality of the foregoing, Provider is solely responsible for all billings and collections from
            patients and other consumers, and NotYet shall have no liability whatsoever to Provider with respect to any
            amounts owed by any patient or other consumer to Provider.</p>
         
        <p>NotYet does not provide any medical advice, legal advice, or representations in any way regarding any legal
            or medical issues associated with Provider, goods, or services offered by Provider, including but not
            limited to any compliance obligations or steps necessary to comply with any state or federal laws and
            regulations. Provider should seek legal counsel regarding any legal and compliance issues, and should not
            rely on any materials or content associated with the Services in determining Provider’s compliance
            obligations under law. THE SERVICES ARE NOT MEANT TO SUBSTITUTE OR MODIFY YOUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN ANY
            WAY.</p>
         
        <p>Provider will use the Services only in accordance with applicable standards of good medical practice. While
            products such the Services can facilitate and improve the quality of service that Provider can offer
            patients, many factors, including but not limited to the provider/patient relationship can affect a patient
            outcome, and with intricate and interdependent technologies and complex decision-making it is often
            difficult or impossible to accurately determine what the factors were and in what proportion they affected
            an outcome. Provider shall be solely responsible for its use of the Services, and the provision of medical
            services to Provider’s patients. In this regard, Provider releases NotYet and waives any and all potential
            claims against NotYet as a result of Provider’s use of the Services, and the provision of services to
            Provider’s patients.</p>

            features of the Services at any time, without notice.</p>
         
         
        <h4>Modified Devices and Operating Systems</h4>

        <p>You may be granted access to our products and services through a third party, including resellers and others
            who include our services and products as part of their own offerings (the “Reseller Third Parties”). Your
            wireless carrier, the manufacturer and retailer of your mobile device, the developer of the operating system
            for your mobile device, the operator of any application store, marketplace, or similar service through which
            you obtain the Services, and their respective affiliates, suppliers, and licensors, as well as the Reseller
            Third Parties, (collectively, the “Select Third Parties”) are not parties to these Terms of Use and they do
            not own and are not responsible for the Services. NotYet, and not any Select Third Parties, is responsible
            for addressing any claims raised by you or any third party regarding the Services or your use or possession
            thereof, including, but not limited to, claims related to product liability, legal, or regulatory
            requirements, and consumer protection or similar legislation. You are responsible for complying with all
            application store and other applicable Select Third Parties’ terms and conditions. YOU AGREE: (A) THE SELECT
            THIRD PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
            LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUALITY OF
            INFORMATION, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; (B) IN NO EVENT WILL THE SELECT THIRD PARTIES BE LIABLE
            TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THESE
            TERMS OF USE OR THE SERVICES, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES;
            AND (C) IN ANY EVENT, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF ANY SELECT THIRD PARTY FOR ALL CLAIMS (WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
            TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE) OF EVERY KIND WILL IN NOT EXCEED FIVE DOLLARS ($5.00); AND (IV)
            YOU WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, NOW KNOWN OR LATER DISCOVERED, THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST THE SELECT THIRD
            PARTIES ARISING OUT OF THE SERVICES, AND THESE TERMS OF USE. THE THIRD PARTIES ARE INTENDED THIRD PARTY
            BENEFICIARIES OF THESE TERMS OF USE, AND ARE CAPABLE OF DIRECTLY ENFORCING ITS TERMS. NOTHING CONTAINED IN
            THESE TERMS OF USE WILL BE CONSTRUED AS MODIFYING OR AMENDING ANY AGREEMENTS OR OTHER TERMS BETWEEN YOU AND
            THE SELECT THIRD PARTIES WITH REGARD TO THEIR SUBJECT MATTER. In the event of any claim that the Services,
            or your possession and use of the Services infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights, the
            Select Third Parties are not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, or discharge of the
            infringement claim.</p>
         
        <p>Additionally, by using the Device, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the underlying wireless carrier
            supplying services to NotYet, and its officers, employees, and agents against any and all claims, including
            without limitation claims for libel, slander, infringement of copyright, or personal injury or death,
            arising in any way directly or indirectly in connection with the use, failure to use, or inability to use
            the access telephone number associated with the Device.</p>
         
        <h4>Entire Agreement</h4>
         
        <p>If you are a Provider, your use of the Services may be separately governed by an agreement between NotYet and
            your employer (“Customer Agreements”). In the event of a conflict between the Customer Agreement and any
            other agreement between NotYet and these Terms of Use, the Customer Agreement shall govern and control.
            Except for Customer Agreements, these Terms of Use, and our Privacy Policy you have consented to constitute
            the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services and supersede all prior or
            contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto. No failure to
            exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of you or us, any right or any power hereunder shall
            operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder
            preclude further exercise of that or any other right hereunder. In the event of a conflict between these
            Terms of Use and any applicable purchase order or other terms, the terms of these Terms of Use shall govern.
            If any provision of these Terms of Use is illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of
            the provision will be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term and all
            other provisions of these Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect. You may not assign, delegate,
            or subcontract these Terms of Use without the prior, written permission or NotYet. The headings of sections
            and paragraphs in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and shall not affect its interpretation. For
            purposes of these Terms of Use, (a) the words “include,” “includes,” and “including” are deemed to be
            followed by the words “without limitation”; (b) the word “or” is not exclusive; and (c) the words
            “herein,” “hereof,” “hereby,” “hereto,” and “hereunder” refer to these Terms of Use as a
            whole.</p>
