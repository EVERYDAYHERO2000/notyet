        <p>NotYet Inc.</p>
        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>NotYet Inc. (“NotYet,” “we”, “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy and we are committed to protecting it
            through our compliance with this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”).</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when
            you visit or use the NotYet monitoring service (the “Monitoring Service”), the medical wearable device
            (the “Wearable Device”), and the associated mobile application (the “Mobile App,”
            collectively with the Monitoring Service and the Wearable Device, the “Service”) (as provided under our
            Terms of Use) and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that
            information.</p>

        <p>This policy applies to information we collect:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Through the Service.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In email, text and other electronic messages between you and NotYet through the Service.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When and where available, through mobile application as offered in Service.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When you interact with our advertising and applications on third party websites and services, if
                    those applications or advertising include links to this Privacy Policy.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>It does not apply to information collected by:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Us through any other means, including on any other website operated by us (such as <a
                        href="https://notyet.tech">https://notyet.tech</a>) or</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries), including through any application or
                    content that may link to or be accessible from the Service.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note, NotYet is not a medical group. Any medical advice or care obtained through our Service or the use of
            our Services will be provided by your health care providers (each, a “Provider”), not NotYet. Your Provider
            is responsible for providing you with a Notice of Privacy Practices describing its collection and use of
            your health information, not NotYet. If you do not agree to be bound by those terms, you are not authorized
            to access or use our Service, and you must promptly discontinue use of our Service.</p>

        <p>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how
            we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you may choose not to use our
            Service. By accessing or using this Service, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
            This policy may change from time to time and will be posted at <a
                href="https://notyet.tech/documents/privacy_policy">https://notyet.tech/documents/privacy_policy</a>.
            Your continued use of this Service after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so
            please check the policy periodically for updates.</p>

        <h3>Health Information</h3>
         
        <p>Some information NotYet collects constitutes protected health information (“PHI”) under the U.S. Health
            Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). As set forth above, your Provider will provide you
            with a Notice of Privacy Practices describing its collection and use of your health information, not NotYet,
            Inc. Accordingly, NotYet will use PHI only for the purpose for which it was collected, and we only collect
            the information we need to fully perform our services, to respond to you or your Provider, or as otherwise
            permitted by the Provider or applicable law. We may use your PHI to contact you, to provide requested
            services, to provide information to your Provider, Caretaker and insurers, to obtain payment for our
            services, to respond to your inquiries and requests, to improve our products or services, and to respond to
            inquiries and requests from your Providers and benefits program. We may combine your information with other
            information about you that is available to us, including information from other sources, such as from your
            Providers, insurers or benefits program, in order to maintain an accurate record of our participants. PHI
            will not be used for any other purpose, including marketing, without your consent.</p>
         
        <p>Some information we collect may be health and/or medical related, however, may not be considered PHI under
            HIPAA (“Non-PHI Health Information”). For example, if you purchase a Service directly from us (as opposed to
            pursuant to instructions, orders or advice from a Provider in connection with your medical treatment) health
            information collected by the Service would not typically be considered PHI under HIPAA. Nonetheless, unlike
            many wearable health device manufacturers and providers, we handle your Non-PHI Health Information with the
            same or substantially similar security (e.g., encryption, access controls and other administrative,
            technical and physical security safeguards) as we use when we handle and protect your PHI. (See the Data
            Security section below for additional information about encryption and other security measures.)</p>
         
        <h3>Children Under the Age of 18</h3>
         
        <p>If you are under the age of eighteen (18), you cannot use the Service. If we learn that we have collected
            personal information from someone under the age of 18, we will promptly delete that information. If you
            believe we have impermissibly collected personal information from someone under the age of 18, please
            contact us at info@notyet.tech.</p>
         
        <h3>Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It</h3>

        <p>When you use and interact with our Service, and as you navigate through and interact with our mobile

        <p>We may also collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites or
            other online services (“behavioral tracking”). Please email us at info@notyet.tech for information
            on how you can opt out of behavioral tracking on this Service and how we respond to web browser signals and

        <p>The technologies we may use for automatic data collection include:</p>
         
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><i>Cookies (or browser cookies)</i>. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your
                    computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your
                    browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our
                    Service when made commercially available. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it
                    will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to the Service.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><i>Web Beacons or Pixel Tags</i>. Pages of the Service and our emails may contain small
                    electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, single-pixel
                    gifs) and other tracking technologies that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited
                    those pages or opened an email, and for other related statistics (for example, recording the
                    popularity of certain content and verifying system and server integrity).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><i>Tracking Codes</i>. A tracking code is a snippet of JavaScript code that tracks the
                    activity of a user by collecting data and sending it to the analytics module. The code is generated
                    automatically, and has to be installed on each page you want to track.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</h3>
         
        <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created
            mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:</p>

            <li>
                <p><i>Promotional Offers from Us.</i> If you do not wish to have your email address or other
                    contact information further used by us to promote our own products or services, you can opt-out by
                    clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email. If we have sent you a promotional

            parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third
            parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. You

        <h3>Accessing</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>Correcting</strong> <strong>and Deleting</strong>
            <strong>Your Information</h3>
         
        <p>You can change your personal information by accessing your account on the Service, or to correct or delete
            any personal information that you have provided to us. We may not be able to delete your personal
            information except by also deleting your user account where one exists. We may not accommodate a request to
            change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the
            information to be incorrect.</p>
         
        <p>With respect to any PHI NotYet may obtain, you have certain rights under HIPAA to access your data, to delete
            your data, to restrict use and disclosure of it, to request communication methods, to request corrections to
            your data, to receive an accounting of disclosures and to receive notice of any breach. To exercise these
            rights, we may direct you to your Provider to fulfill your request, or seek your Provider’s permission to do
            so before fulfilling such request. See the Notice of Privacy</p>
         
        <h3>Data Security</h3>
         
        <p>Our goal is to protect your Personal Information submitted to us through this Service. We maintain reasonable
            administrative, organizational, and technical safeguards to protect and limit access to your personal
            information. This includes encrypting the data at rest on the Service as well as encrypting during
            transmission (in motion) between the Service and the mobile application. However, no method of
            transmission over the Internet or electronic storage technology is 100% secure. Therefore, while we take
            reasonable measures to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
         
        <p>Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your
            personal information transmitted to our Service. Any transmission of personal information is at your own
            risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the
            Service.</p>
         
        <h3>California Privacy Rights</h3>
         
        <p>These California Privacy Rights supplement the other information contained in our Privacy Policy and applies
            solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (“consumers” or “you”). This
            notice is to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and any terms defined in the
            CCPA have the same meaning when used in this notice. We may update these California Privacy Rights as
            necessary and in the event of changes in the CCPA. These terms apply only to California residents. Please
            note that the CCPA expressly excludes personal information regulated under the California Confidentiality of
            Medical Information Act (CMIA) and protected health information (PHI) collected by a “covered entity” (e.g.,
            a health care provider or insurance plan) or “business associate” (e.g., NotYet) that provides services to a
            covered entity governed by HIPAA.</p>
         
        <p><i>Categories of Personal Information</i> <i>NotYet</i> <i>Collects</i></p>

        <p>Personal information does not include information that is: (a) publicly available information from government

            describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not
            use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>
         
        <p><i>Disclosures of Personal Information for Business Purposes</i></p>
